Teaching Practice
<Hr Align="left" Width="35%">
</h1>
<br>
<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">
 Up to now, I have gone through girls' schools from junior high school to university, and my club activities were mostly cultural ones. I am a kind of “Ama-chan” who has received education in a very relaxed, gentle environment unique to girls' schools. I will introduce the episode that “Ama-chan” like me awakens to the spirit of “never give up”.
</br>
<br>
 That is my experience in teaching practice training when I was senior in university. The training took about three weeks from the end of May to the middle of June in my senior year of university. I took the teaching practice training at a girls' high school I graduated from. For me, this teaching practice training is the biggest event in the teacher training course that goes on from the first year of university.
</br>
<br>
 My experience from the teaching practice is just for a limited period of 3 weeks, and the range of practical training is mainly preparation for class and lecture in class. It is only a glimpse of the actual teacher's whole activities. However, prior to the teaching practice, I was just a “Ama-chan” who had been grown up in girls' school environment from junior high school to university. To me the teaching practice was so harsh that I had never gone through in my life.
</br>
<br>
 First of all, I was supposed to make 8 lectures in the classroom during the teaching practice training. Therefore, I prepared teaching plans for 8 lessons prior to the training. Of course, I did my best preparing for them. However, after the training, I was requested to rewrite all plans of 8 lessons that I had prepared. Can you imagine how many hours a participating student in a teaching practice training can sleep during a practice period?  During the 3 week teaching practice period, I had only 3 or, 4 hours to sleep every night in order to spare time rewriting the teaching plans. Besides me, other participants in the training at the same school seemed to have the same hours to sleep. I wonder who will be able to survive with 3 or 4 hour sleep a day for ever ?
</br>
<br>
 After taking the teaching practice at school, I felt deeply that being a teacher is such a hard and harsh occupation. I realized that without a strong obligation and responsibility to the occupation as a teacher, more directly to the students in class, teachers could not maintain their profession at all and would give in to their harsh working environment. They seem to be too busy and responsible to take a break, including thorough preparation for classes, giving guidance to students, preparation of various reports, and responsibilities for the club activities of the students.
</br>
<br>
 With the support of my instructing teacher at the school, I finished rewriting my teaching plans good enough for me to make lectures in the classroom. However, my experience of making the first lecture in the classroom was so miserable. There, I faced a lot of questions and responses from the students that I hadn’t anticipated. I felt so disappointed. 
</br>
<br>
 I wish I were a phoenix from the ash. Feeling at the bottom I had nothing to lose but would rise there. I reconsidered the questions and points that the students would raise in the class. Furthermore, I repeated the simulation for the classes until I was satisfied with myself with the support of my supervisor. 
</br>
<br>
 As result, I successfully gained very positive reaction from the students when making lectures in the classroom. On the last day of the practical training, I got a notebook with message of thanks and encouragement from the instructor and students. I was filled with the thought that my efforts were rewarded. Such fulfillment and my gratitude to them forced me to give drops of tears.

Ambition

<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">
<br>
 The next is about my ambition. Currently, I major in mathematics and information at university. In the future, I would like to become a quants, analyst, system engineer and the like, making full use of my majors and working across the country borders. To that end, I am constantly striving to improve my English skill such as TOEIC, acquire qualifications for bookkeeping as a necessary element for a worker, as well as further study on my majors.

Leadership
<Hr Align="left" Width="20%">

<font face="ＭＳ 明朝">
<br>
　Finally, it is my leadership. When I was a sophomore at the university, the mathematics circle to which I belonged gave a number of programming exhibits at the university festival. As leader for the group of 6 members, I was responsible for one of these programming exhibitions. My role was to collect the programming sources from the members in the group, facilitate communication among them and keep the project in line with the schedule during the preparatory period of the university festival.
</br>
<br>
　Leadership is a strength in the third point. We exhibited programming at the cultural festival in the second year of university. The programming exhibition was held in a group of six people, I was a group leader. As a leader, in order to make the cultural festure successful, collect the sources of all members in the group by the preparation date of the cultural festival, exchange closely with the group members, learn about the progress of the work and programming, cooperate with the group We set up a study group with teachers and members to do and prepared for the day of the cultural festival. It was worth it, and I was able to finish exhibition activities safely at the cultural festival. At the cultural festival, many customers came and got a great sense of accomplishment.
